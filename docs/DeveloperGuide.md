## **Introduction** 

Pawbook is a desktop application for dog school managers to facilitate their bookkeeping of puppies and dogs in the
school, optimized for input via a **Command Line Interface (CLI)** which caters to fast-typers who prefer to use a 
keyboard. You can navigate the application with ease and execute instructions by typing text-based commands in the 
command box provided without ever having to reach for your mouse!

## **Purpose** 

This document aims to serve as a guide for developers, testers and designers who are interested in working on Pawbook. 
It describes both the design and architecture of Pawbook. 

## **Target User Profile**

The target user profile are dog school managers that own and manage the daily operations of the dog schools. They
handle a wide range of operations such as keeping track of the dogs under their care, arranging programs and taking care
of the dogs on a daily basis. They need a systematic way of maintaining their handle on the operations of their school
at all times.

## **Value Proposition**

In Singapore, dog schools are popular among dog owners. Besides day care, they also provide training,
grooming and workshops. With many moving parts daily, managing operations  can get overwhelming.
PawBook is an all-in-one management system to help dog school managers to maintain organisation of their dog schools. 
Besides keeping track of all the dogs under their care, it also allows users to plan their schedule and manage programs 
and classes. At present, there is no such application to help dog school owners to organise and manage their dog school 
currently. This application serves to increase the effectiveness and efficacy of dog schools managers.

## **Design**

### Architecture

![Architecture Diagram](images/ArchitectureDiagram.png){: .center-image}

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-T10-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/dog/pawbook/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-T10-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/dog/pawbook/MainApp.java). It is responsible for:
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the local persistent storage.

Each of the four components,

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* exposes its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which implements the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which implements the `Logic` interface.

![Class Diagram of the Logic Component](images/LogicClassDiagram.png){: .center-image}

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete owner 1`.

![Architecture Sequence Diagram](images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png){: .center-image}

The sections below give more details of each component. 

### UI component

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png){: .center-image}

**API** :
[`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-T10-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/dog/pawbook/ui/Ui.java)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `EntityListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-T10-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/dog/pawbook/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-T10-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

### Logic component

![Structure of the Logic Component](images/LogicClassDiagram.png){: .center-image}

**API** :
[`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-T10-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/dog/pawbook/logic/Logic.java)

1. `Logic` uses the `PawbookParser` class to parse the user command.
2. This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
3. The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a owner).
4. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
5. In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete owner 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete owner 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png){: .center-image}

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteOwnerCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

### Model component

![Structure of the Model Component](images/ModelClassDiagram.png){: .center-image}

**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-T10-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/dog/pawbook/model/Model.java)

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences.
* stores the pawbook database data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Entity>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

### Storage component

![Structure of the Storage Component](images/StorageClassDiagram.png){: .center-image}

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-T10-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/dog/pawbook/storage/Storage.java)

The `Storage` component,
* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the Pawbook Database data in json format and read it back.

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `pawbook.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Entities: Owner/Dog/Program

![EntityClassDiagram](images/EntityClassDiagram.png){: .center-image}

Despite having three closely related entities in Pawbook, the actual implementation does not couple the 3 entities together in any ways. Instead of storing a reference between an Owner and their Dog, a symbolic ID number is used to represent these links. This ensures that data objects continue to only store information and leave the control/manipulation of data to the logic side of the application. It is therefore possible for all the various entities to remain immutable as well.

This necessitates that an unique ID number is assigned to every entity during its creation and remain constant throughout its lifetime in the application. A simple numbering system is used here whereby the ID is generated by incrementing from 1 until an unused number is found, gaps between numbers will only be filled after a restart of the application to simplify the code.

The ID system replaces the original implementation that uses the index of every Person in the visible list. This gives the advantage of being able to reference to any entity on any screen, which can be useful since different entities are not displayed together.

The `UniqueEntityList` contains pairs of ID and entity. This attempts to mimic a map/dictionary while keeping possible to continue using the original UI components with minimal changes to the code. Every entity does not store its ID as an internal attribute due to the fact that ID is dynamically generated, usually after the instantiation of the entity itself. The ability to set or change the ID during the lifetime of the entity will violate the immutability of the entities. Furthermore, there is no need for the any entity to be aware of its ID.

#### Alternative Implementation: Using a Hashmap as container for unique entities

A hashmap was briefly considered as a candidate for storing the unique entities as it was a natural fit.

Benefits:
* Much faster lookup when retrieving an entity by its ID or to check for ID clashes.

Drawbacks:
* Hashmaps have no inherent order, it will be quickly become expensive to maintain order whenever there are data changes.
* There is no `FilteredList` equivalent for maps in JavaFX, filtering cannot be simply achieve within `Model` and will need to be done on the GUI side.

This current implementation though not ideal, avoid many potential rewrites since there is no `ListView` equivalent for maps in JavaFX. Switching to using a hashmap as underlying data structure will mean that a table will need to be used to display all the entries, adding unnecessary complication to the code as filtering and sorting will no longer as be simple. Most of these changes are under-the-hood and does not improve user experience significantly.

### Adding/Deleting feature

![AddDeleteCommandClassDiagram](images/AddDeleteCommandClassDiagram.png){: .center-image}

Pawbook manages more than one type of entity, each with their own unique attributes. An OOP approach is used here whereby both the `AddCommand` and `DeleteCommand` are generic classes that extends the `Command` class. This way any number of other classes extending `entity` can be added/deleted as well.

Example: `add owner n/NAME p/PHONE e/EMAIL a/ADDRESS [t/TAG]...`

#### Implementation

The actual execution of the different add commands are highly similar and often differ only by the extra entity-specific checks, e.g. verifying that the owner ID refers to an actual owner instead of taking in an arbitrary number. The same applies to delete commands as well.

![AddDeleteCommandParserClassDiagram](images/AddDeleteCommandParserClassDiagram.png){: .center-image}

In order to generate the respective commands, the raw input needs to be parsed first. It is required that the user provide a second keyword right after the `add`/`delete` command keyword to indicate the correct entity type to be added. Using this information, the arguments can be forwarded to the correct parser from within `PawbookParser` to generate the actual add/delete commands.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the add command behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application and executes `add owner n/BRUCE p/92019201 e/bruce@example.com a/BLK 123 Adam Road t/friendly` to save an owner.

Step 2. The owner is added to the model.

Below is an example activity diagram for a valid add command from the user.

![AddActivityDiagram](images/DeleteActivityDiagram.png){: .center-image}

The activity diagram for both add and delete commands are mirrored. Based on the name of the entity type supplied, the correct parser will be instantiated to parse the arguments and generate the executable command. 

To further illustrate how an actual deletion of an entity is performed, below is an example sequence diagram for a valid delete command from the user.

![DeleteSequenceDiagram](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png){: .center-image}

The deletion of any entity will typically affect other related entities as well, as shown in a more details sequence diagram below.

![DeleteSequenceDetailedDiagram](images/DeleteSequenceDetailedDiagram.png){: .center-image}

This is how the `DeleteDogCommand` works upon execution:
1. The `Dog` to be deleted will first be retrieved from the `Model`.
2. Using the ID stored in the `Dog`, the `Owner` can be retrieved from `Model` as well.
3. A new `Owner` with the same details except without the current `Dog`'s ID will be created to replace the current `Owner` instance in the `Model`.
4. A list of `Program` that the `Dog` is enrolled in will be generated.
5. For each of these `Program`, it will be edited to remove the current `Dog`'s ID.
6. With no more entities referring to the current `Dog`, it is safe to call `Model#deleteEntity(...)` to delete the `Dog`.

The various add commands will similarly perform the reverse of the delete command.

### Edit feature

Pawbook allows the user to `edit` an entity. For instance, the user may want to `edit`  some features of an owner. By entering the edit command with the correct identification number of the owner to be edited, the specified features of the owner will be modified accordingly.

In order to generate the respective commands, the raw input needs to be parsed first. It is required that the user provide a second keyword right after the `edit` command keyword to indicate the correct entity type to be edited. Using this information, the arguments can be forwarded to the correct parser from within `PawbookParser` to be further processed.

Below is an example activity diagram for a valid view command from the user.

![EditActivityDiagram](images/EditActivityDiagram.png){: .center-image}

### Find feature

Pawbook allows the users to `find` an entity based on keyword searches. The `find` function entertains multiple keyword
searches and reveals the entire list of commands that match one or more of the results.

When the user enters a valid command with the keyword searches, the arguments are parsed by the `FindCommmandParser` that
converts the string of arguments into a list, that is subsequently passed on to a `NameContainsKeywordsPredicate` object
that uses the list of keywords to find the search results based on the supplied keywords. Take note that Find Command supports 
substring searching, so for example if there is an Alice in the program, searching "Ali" will also return Alice as result. 

Below is an example activity diagram for a valid find command from the user.

![FindActivityDiagram](images/FindActivityDiagram.png){: .center-image}

Below is an example sequence diagram for a valid find command from the user.

![FindActivityDiagram](images/FindSequenceDiagram.png){: .center-image}

1. The `LogicManager` uses the `PawbookParser` to parse the given user input.
2. The `PawbookParser` identifies the user command and creates a `FindCommandParser` object. It then calls the `FindCommandParser`'s `parse()`method with user input as the parameter.
3. In the `parse()` method, the `FindCommandParser` will then generate the `FindCommand` object. This is then returned all the way back to the `LogicManager`.
4. The `LogicManager` will then proceed to call the `execute()` method.
5. The `execute()` method is further explored below. The high level understanding is that a CommandResult is returned and finally passed back to `LogicManager`.

Here is a more specific breakdown of the command's execute method.

![ViewSequenceDiagramSpecific](images/FindSequenceDiagramSpecific.png) 

1. Upon calling the `execute()` method, the `FindCommand` updates the filtered entity list in `Model` using a `NameContainsKeywordsPredicate` as parameter. 
2. It then sorts the entity using the `sortEntities()` in increasing order by using a `COMPARATOR_ID_ASCENDING_ORDER` comparator that orders entities in increasing ID order. 
3. From here, Find Command creates a command result and returns it to the `LogicManager`.

### View feature

Pawbook allows the user to `view` an entity and all its related entities. For instance, the user may want to `view` all the dogs of one particular owner or all the dogs enrolled in a program. By entering the correct view command with the correct identification number, the entire list will be generated.

When the user enters a valid command with the target entity ID, the ViewCommandParser will firstly parse the command and store the ID as an integer that is then passed on to as a parameter into the constructor method of a new ViewCommand instance.

Subsequently, once the new `ViewCommand` instance has been created, in its execute method, it will retrieve the entity via the ID that was passed in, from the `ModelManager`. With a handle on the target entity now, we build a list consisting of the entity IDs that are to be shown as search results.

Based on the class type of the target entity, we will reveal the search results accordingly. If the target entity is a `Dog`, then we will show the relevant owner profile. If the target entity is a `Owner`, then we will list out all of the owner's dogs. Similar to owner, for `Program`, we will reveal the full list of dogs enrolled in that program.

This list is subsequently passed on to the `RelatedEntityPredicate` that will later be used in the ModelManager's `updatefilteredEntityList())` method to finally reveal the search results.

Take note that this is the order in which results will be displayed, based on target entity searched:
* **View Dog**: Dog > Owner > Programs enrolled in
* **View Owner**: Owner > Dogs owned 
* **View Program**: Program > Dogs enrolled

Below is an example activity diagram for a valid view command from the user.

![ViewActivityDiagram](images/ViewActivityDiagram.png){: .center-image}

Below is an example sequence diagram for a valid view command from the user.

![ViewSequenceDiagram](images/ViewSequenceDiagram.png){: .center-image}

1. The `LogicManager` uses the `PawbookParser` to parse the given user input. 
2. The `PawbookParser` identifies the user command and creates a `ViewCommandParser` object. It then calls the `ViewCommandParser`'s `parse()`method with user input as the parameter. 
3. In the `parse()` method, the `ViewCommandParser` will then generate the `ViewCommand` object. This is then returned all the way back to the `LogicManager`. 
4. The `LogicManager` will then proceed to call the `execute()` method. 
5. The `execute()` method is further explored below. The high level understanding is that a CommandResult is returned and finally passed back to `LogicManager`.

Here is a more specific breakdown of the command's execute method.

![ViewSequenceDiagramSpecific](images/ViewSequenceDiagramSpecific.png) 

1. In the execute method of `ViewCommand`, it first generates a list of related entity IDs by calling the `generateRelatedIdList()`which accesses the data in the model. 
2. This list is then passed into the constructor method of `IdMatchPredicate` and is then passed into `updateFilteredEntityList()` method. The `updateFilteredEntityList()` updates the filtered entity list in model. 
3. Next, `ViewCommand` creates a `ViewCommandComparator` and uses it to sort the ordering of the filtered entity list. 
4. From there, `ViewCommand` generates the `CommandResult` based on the filtered entity list. This portion is not shown here as it is trivial.

### Enrol feature

Pawbook supports the enrolling of specific dogs into specific programs.

In order to enrol a dog into a program, the raw input needs to be parsed first. It is required that the user provides 2 parameters, namely `dogId` and `programId`. These inputs have the prefix `/d` and `/p`, and is followed by an integer. Using this information, the arguments will be forwarded to the `EnrolCommandParser` from within `PawbookParser`, which converts the String input to int.

Below is an example activity diagram for a valid enrol command from the user.

![EnrolActivityDiagram](images/EnrolActivityDiagram.png){: .center-image}

Below is an example sequence diagram for a valid enrol command from the user.

![EnrolSequenceDiagram](images/EnrolSequenceDiagram.png){: .center-image}

1. The `LogicManager` uses the `PawbookParser` to parse the given user input.
1. The `PawbookParser` will identify the command given by the user based on the first command word and pass the user input down to `EnrolDropCommandParser`.
1. The `EnrolDropCommandParser` will then create an `enrolCommand` object with the user input `dogIdSet` and `programIdSet` as input parameters, in this case,
`dogIdSet` will be `[2]` and `programIdSet` will be `[3]`.
1. The `EnrolDropCommandParser` will then return an `enrolCommand` object.
1. The `LogicManager` will now call the `execute` method in the `enrolCommand` object.
1. The `EnrolCommand` will now call the `updateFilteredEntityList` method of the existing `Model` object.
1. The high level understanding is that a `CommandResult` is returned and finally passed back to `LogicManager`.

Here is a more specific breakdown of the command's execute method.

![EnrolSequenceSpecificDiagram](images/EnrolSequenceSpecificDiagram.png){: .center-image}

1. The `LogicManager` will call the execute method in the `EnrolCommand` object. 
1. The `EnrolCommand` will then call the `checkIdValidity` method of the existing `Model` object.
1. If the ID is valid, the `EnrolCommand` will create an `IdMatchPredicate` object.
1. The `EnrolCommand` will call the `updateFilteredEntityList` method of the existing `Model` object update the `IdMatchPredicate` object into Pawbook.
1. The `EnrolCommand` then creates a `CommandResult` object and returns it, indicating the successful updating of the `IdMatchPredicate` object.

### Drop feature

While Pawbook allows the enrolling of dogs into programs, conversely it supports dropping previously-enrolled dogs from the programs.

To drop a dog from a program, the raw input is parsed and goes through several checks to ensure that the provided dog and program IDs are both valid and are indeed referring to dog and program objects respectively. Subsequently, the arguments will be forwarded to `DropCommandParser` followed by `PawbookParser` where they are converted from the String input to int.

Below is an example activity diagram for a valid drop command from the user.

![DropActivityDiagram](images/DropActivityDiagram.png){: .center-image}

Below is an example sequence diagram for a valid drop command from the user.

![DropSequenceDiagram](images/DropSequenceDiagram.png){: .center-image}

1. The `LogicManager` uses the `PawbookParser` to parse the given user input.
1. The `PawbookParser` will identify the command given by the user based on the first command word and pass the user input down to `EnrolDropCommandParser`.
1. The `EnrolDropCommandParser` will then create a `dropCommand` object with the user input `dogIdSet` and `programIdSet` as input parameters, in this case,
`dogIdSet` will be [2] and `programIdSet` will be [3].
1. The `EnrolDropCommandParser` will then return a `enrolCommand` object.
1. The `LogicManager` will now call the execute method in the `dropCommand` object.
1. The `DropCommand` will now call the `updateFilteredEntityList` method of the existing `Model` object.
1. The high level understanding is that a `CommandResult` is returned and finally passed back to `LogicManager`.

Here is a more specific breakdown of the command's `execute` method.

![DropSequenceDiagramSpecific](images/DropSequenceDiagramSpecific.png){: .center-image}

1. The `LogicManager` will call the execute method in the `DropCommand` object. 
1. The `DropCommand` will then call the `checkIdValidity` method of the existing `Model` object.
1. If the ID is valid, the `DropCommand` will create an `IdMatchPredicate` object.
1. The `DropCommand` will call the `updateFilteredEntityList` method of the existing `Model` object update the `IdMatchPredicate` object into Pawbook.
1. The `DropCommand` then creates a `CommandResult` object and returns it, indicating the successful updating of the `IdMatchPredicate` object. 

### Alternate implementations

As dogs and programs can also be identified by their respective names instead of IDs, another implementation could be replacing the parameters of `dogId` and `programId` with their respective names.

However, this requires there to be no duplicate dog or program names.
