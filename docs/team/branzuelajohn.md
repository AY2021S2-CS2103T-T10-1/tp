## Project: Pawbook
Pawbook is a desktop application for dog school managers to facilitate their bookkeeping of puppies and dogs in the school, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).
Besides maintaining dog profiles for each unique dog, managers can view daily class schedules on Pawbook to better plan the dayâ€™s activities. 

This portfolio aims to document the contributions that I have made to Pawbook. In this project, our team - Pawbook, will enhance a basic CLI Address Book 3 (AB3) and repurpose it to create our application: Pawbook.
