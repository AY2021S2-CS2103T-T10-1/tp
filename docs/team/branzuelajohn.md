## Project: Pawbook

Pawbook is a desktop application for dog school managers to facilitate their bookkeeping of puppies and dogs in the
school, optimized for use via a **Command Line Interface (CLI)** which caters to fast-typers who prefer to use a
keyboard. You can navigate the application with ease and execute instructions by typing text-based commands in the
command box provided.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Add Command
  * Implemented the AddDogCommand and AddProgramCommand that adds dogs and programs to the database.
  * I had to create the Dog class and Program class respectively.
  * Furthermore, I had to create the relevant identity/data field classes for these two entities such as Breed, Sex, etc.
  * In the process, I had to build `AddDogCommandParser`, `AddProgramCommandParser` to allow the proper functioning of this command.
  
* **New Feature**: Delete Command
  * Implemented the `DeleteProgramCommand` that deletes program from the database.
  * In the process, I had to build `DeleteProgramCommandParser`

* **New Feature**: Autocomplete
  * Implemented the autocomplete feature that provides suggestions to users of the application as they
  type into the command box.
