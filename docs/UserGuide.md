### Add Command: Create a dog/owner/program

**Function**: Creates an entry for an entity (dog/owner/program) and adds to Pawbook.<br>
**Use case**: When you want to create a new entry for a new customer or program, this is the right command! For instance, when a new dog arrives at the school with its owner, you will first need to add the owner followed by the dog.

Format:

```
add dog n/DOG_NAME b/BREED d/DATE_OF_BIRTH s/SEX o/OWNER_ID [t/TAG]...
add owner n/OWNER_NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER e/EMAIL a/ADDRESS [t/TAG]...

```

Note:

- Different prefixes should be used for the respective entities to specify details.
- Names are allowed to contain basic Latin letters, numerics, hyphens, commas, periods and apostrophes. This is catered for cases when a program name contains numbers and in some cases, even dog names and owner names. Extra punctuation are subjected to common usages.
- Pawbook support arbitrary length phone numbers. This is to support phone numbers with differing lengths from different regions.
- Tags are optional and multiple tags can be added.
- Tags are only able to take in one alphanumeric string. To write tags with multiple words, consider using camelCase for combining multiple words.
- Date format used is <kbd>dd-MM-yyyy</kbd>, time format is <kbd>HH:mm</kbd>. For date and time of sessions, it will need therefore need to follow <kbd>dd-MM-yyyy HH:mm</kbd>.<br>

Date time part| Code | Valid values

Year | <kbd>yyyy</kbd> | 0000~9999

![Add Command Result](images/AddCommandScreenshot2.png)

### Delete Command: Remove a dog/owner/program

**Function**: Remove the entry for an entity (dog/owner/program) from Pawbook.<br>
**Use case**: When you want to delete an entity, you can simply use the delete command and delete the entity that you want using their ID number. For instance, when a dog is no longer under your care, you can delete the dog's profile using this command.

Format:

```
delete dog DOG_ID
delete owner OWNER_ID
delete program PROGRAM_ID
```

Note:

- The ID must be a positive integer 1, 2, 3 etc.

Examples:

1. Deletes the owner with ID 1 in Pawbook.<br>
   Command: `delete owner 1`

2. Deletes the dog with ID 2 in Pawbook.<br>
   Command: `delete dog 2`

3. Deletes the program with ID 3 in Pawbook.<br>
   Command: `delete program 3`

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">
:heavy_exclamation_mark: Take note that deleting an owner will automatically delete all the dogs that belong to that owner as well. We do not allow dogs in Pawbook to not have an owner!

:heavy_exclamation_mark: Requiring the type of entity you are deleting to be specified helps ensure that you do not accidentally delete the wrong entity and lose important customer data!

:bulb: Deleting using ID instead of name? Yes, all commands other than `add` and `find` uses the entity's ID. When a new entity is added to Pawbook, the system assigns an unique ID to each of them.
</div>

The ID for all entities is displayed in the first line beside its name.

### Edit Command: Modify the details of a dog/owner/program

**Function**: Edits a dog/owner/program from Pawbook.<br>
**Use case**: This command allows you to edit the attributes of the entity (dog/owner/program) in your Pawbook. Let's say you just added an entry for a dog but you realized that you filled in one of the owner particulars wrongly. The edit command allows you to quickly correct that mistake. More details about each of the editable attributes can be found _[here](#add-command-create-a-dogownerprogram)_.

Format:

```
edit dog DOG_ID [n/DOG_NAME] [b/BREED] [d/DATE_OF_BIRTH] [s/SEX] [o/OWNER_ID] [t/TAG]...
edit owner OWNER_ID [n/OWNER_NAME] [p/PHONE] [e/EMAIL] [a/ADDRESS] [t/TAG]...

```

Note:

- The ID must be a positive integer 1, 2, 3 etc.

2. Edits the dog with ID 2 in Pawbook.<br>
   Command: `edit dog 2 n/Bruce t/playful`

:heavy_exclamation_mark: At least one attribute needs to be modified!
</div>

To edit the phone number of owner with ID 1 to 91234567, type `owner ID p/91234567` into the command box.
![Edit Command](images/EditCommandScreenshot1.png)

![Edit Command Result](images/EditCommandScreenshot2.png)

### Enrol Command: Let a dog join a program

**Function**: Enrol a specified dog to a specified program that the dog was previously not enrolled in. Batch enrolment is also supported, which means that multiple dogs can be enrolled into the same program, or one dog can be enrolled into multiple programs.<br>
**Use case**: When you want to enrol a dog into a specific program, you can use this command. One instance is when after a new dog Bruce has just joined the school and is applying for Obedience Training. You can then enrol Bruce into the Obedience Training program after you have added Bruce into the system.

Format:

```
enrol d/DOG_ID [d/DOG_ID]... p/PROGRAM_ID (enrolling multiple dogs into one program)
enrol d/DOG_ID p/PROGRAM_ID [p/PROGRAM_ID]... (enrolling one dog into multiple programs)
```

   Command: `enrol d/2 p/3 p/4`

:heavy_exclamation_mark: Take note that enrolling multiple dogs into multiple programs at once is **NOT** allowed as it is error-prone.
For example, `enrol d/2 d/3 p/4 p/5` is **NOT** allowed!
</div>

### Drop Command: Remove dogs from enrolled programs

**Function**: Removes a specified dog from a specified program that the dog was previously enrolled in. Batch removal is supported, which means that multiple dogs can be removed from the same program, or a single dog can be removed from multiple programs.<br>
**Use case**: After a dog has finished a program or has dropped out of the program, you can remove him from the program using this command.

Format:

```
drop d/DOG_ID [d/DOG_ID]... p/PROGRAM_ID (removing multiple dogs from one program)
