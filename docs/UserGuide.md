# Commands 

In this section, you will learn about the commands available in Pawbook and how to use them.

### Add Command

**Function**: Adds an entity (dog/owner/program) to Pawbook.<br>
**Usage**: When you want to add an entity into Pawbook, you can simply use the add command. The add command adds the new entity at the end of the current list. 
For instance, when a new dog arrives at the school with its owner, you will need to add the owner profile and the dog profile and store it in Pawbook. 

Note: 

- Date-time format used for sessions is dd-MM-yyyy HH:mm. Same applies to the day format of date of birth which follows dd-MM-yyyy.<br>
  dd -> Day: From 1-31 (Please take note that months like February does not have 29 days in certain years)<br>
  MM -> Month: From 1-12<br>
  yyyy -> Valid year<br>
  HH -> From 1-12<br>
  mm -> From 0-59<br>
  
Format:

```
add dog n/DOG_NAME b/BREED d/DATE_OF_BIRTH s/SEX o/OWNER_ID [t/TAG]...
add owner n/OWNER_NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER e/EMAIL a/ADDRESS [t/TAG]...
add program n/PROGRAM_NAME s/TIME_AND_DATE_OF_SESSION [t/TAG]...
```

Note:

- Different prefixes should be used for the respective entities to specify details.
- Names are allowed to contain numerics. This is catered for cases when a program name contains numbers and in some cases, even dog names and owner names.
- Pawbook support arbitrary length phone numbers. This is to support phone numbers with differing lengths from different regions. 
- Tags are optional and multiple tags can be added.
- Tags are able to only take in one alphanumeric string. To write tags with multiple words, consider using camelCase or _ to represent a space.

Examples:

1. Adds an owner named John with the details provided in Pawbook. <br>
   Command: `add owner n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/311, Clementi Ave 2, #02-25 t/friends t/owesMoney`
2. Adds a dog named BRUCE belonging to owner with ID 1 in Pawbook. <br>
   Command: `add dog n/Bruce b/Chihuahua d/12-02-2019 s/Male o/1 t/playful t/active`
3. Creates a program with program name Obedience Training. <br>
   Command: `add program n/Obedience Training s/02-02-2020 18:00 t/puppies`

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">
:bulb: The order of the prefixes do not matter, feel free to add your information in any order that is convenient for you! <br>
:bulb: Address fields are free from input checking to allow flexibility to users from different countries with different address formats. 
</div>

### Delete Command

**Function**: Deletes an entity (dog/owner/program) from Pawbook. <br>
**Usage**: When you want to delete an entity, you can simply use the delete command and delete the entity that you want via the ID number. 
For instance, when a dog is no longer under your care, you can delete the dog's profile using this command. 

:heavy_exclamation_mark: Take note that deleting an owner will automatically delete all the dogs that belong to that owner as well. 
We do not allow dogs in Pawbook to not have an owner tagged to it!

Format:

```
delete dog DOG_ID
delete owner OWNER_ID
delete program PROGRAM_ID
```

Note: 

- The ID must be a positive integer 1, 2, 3 etc.

Examples:

1. Deletes the owner with ID 1 in Pawbook.<br>
   Command: `delete owner 1`
2. Deletes the dog with ID 2 in Pawbook.<br>
   Command: `delete dog 2`
3. Deletes the program with ID 3 in Pawbook.<br>
   Command: `delete program 3`

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">
:bulb: Deleting using ID instead of name? Yes, all commands other than `add` and `find` uses the entity's ID. 
When a new entity is added to Pawbook, the system assigns a unique ID to each entity.
</div>

### Edit Command

**Function**: Edits a dog/owner/program from Pawbook.<br>
**Usage**: This command allows you to edit the information of the entity (dog/owner/program) in your Pawbook. Let's say

allows you to quickly correct that mistake. More details about the formatting of date of birth and session available _[here](#add-command)_.

Format:

```

### Enrol Command

**Function**: Adds a specified dog to a specified program that the dog was previously not enrolled in. Batch enrolment 
is supported, which means that multiple dogs can be enrolled into the same program, or one dog can be enrolled into 
multiple programs.<br>
**Usage**: When you want to enrol a dog into a specific program, you can use this command. One instance is when after 
a new dog Bruce has just joined the school and is enrolled for Obedience Training. You can then enrol Bruce into the 
Obedience training program after you have added Bruce into the system. 

Format:

```
enrol d/DOG_ID p/PROGRAM_ID
enrol d/DOG_ID [d/DOG_ID]... p/PROGRAM_ID (enrolling multiple dogs into one program)
enrol d/DOG_ID p/PROGRAM_ID [p/PROGRAM_ID]... (enrolling one dog into multiple programs)
```

Note: 

- The dogs and programs must be valid.
- Dog must not be enrolled in the program.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">
:bulb: Even for batch enrolment, the dog must not be enrolled in any of the programs, or all dogs must not be enrolled in that program, in order for the command to work.<br>
:heavy_exclamation_mark: Take note that enrolling multiple dogs into multiple programs at once is **NOT** allowed! 
For example, `enrol d/2 d/3 p/4 p/5` is **NOT** allowed!

**Function**: Removes a specified dog from a specified program that the dog was previously enrolled in. Batch dropping 
is supported, which means that multiple dogs can be dropped from the same program, or one dog can be dropped from

this command. After a dog has been dropped from the program, the program will no longer have that dog ID stored.

You can use this command to have a quick overview of the entities related to each other.
